Steps to import transaction stocks to mongoDB

1. Save transaction file as .csv
2. Go to this website, which will automatic generate csv into json http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm
3. Add the following to the top and bottom of the file.

db = db.getSiblingDB("video"); // video is the db name
db.transactionStocks.drop(); // transactionStocks is the collection name
db.transactionStocks.insertMany([ 
//In between here, have all of the data for your stock transactions//

]);

4. Save the file as xxxx.json and at a directory where the file will be uploaded 
    ssh to the path of where the file is saved: my case it's users/chocomusrt/xxxx/xxx/xxx.json
    Connect to your mongoDB shell
